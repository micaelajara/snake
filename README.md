# Snake game!

Hi! This is my first web game in vanilla Javascript. I choose the  (g)old **Snake Game**. If you want to know the logic you can look the app.js file.

## Files

- app.js -> The logic
- index.html -> The structure
- styles.css -> The style

## How to play

Click in [this link ](https://micaelajara.github.io/snake/) and play with the keys buttons of the keyboard. **You only have one live!**
